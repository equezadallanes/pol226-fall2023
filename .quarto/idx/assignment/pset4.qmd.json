You must use the provided RMarkdown file to complete this problem set.\n\n- Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is \"knitted\" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that show your code and output.]\n\nIf you have any issues using RMarkdown please see me in my office so we can make sure you can knit the file on your computer.\n\n\n1.
