You must use the provided RMarkdown file to complete this problem set.\n\n- Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is \"knitted\" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that show your code and output.]\n\nIf you have any issues using RMarkdown please see me in my office so we can make sure you can knit the file on your computer.\n\n\n1. [Problem Set - PDF](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/604561/)\n2. [RMardown file](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/604560/)\n3. [Dataset](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/604559/)\n\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis fourth problem set will help you practice:\n\n1. Understanding the components of a linear regression model\n2. Running a linear regression model in R\n3. Interpreting the output of the lm() function\n\n\nYou will use the following commands:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\n# From the previous problem sets\nread.csv()\nlm()\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Criteria for success\n\nIn addition to providing the correct code and/or answer, a successful problem set will:\n\n1.
