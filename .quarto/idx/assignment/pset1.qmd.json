You have two options for how to complete the assignment.\n\n1. Type up your answers in a text processor and write your code in an R script. Submit a PDF of the answers as well as your Rscript (2 files).\n2. Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is \"knitted\" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that shows your code and output.]\n\n\n\n\nThis first problem set will help you practice:\n\n1. Setting the working directory\n2. Loading data into R\n3. Viewing and understanding observations from the dataset\n4. Identifying the type of variables you are working with\n\n\nYou will use the following commands:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\nsetwd()\n\nread.csv()\n\nhead()\n\ndim()\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Criteria for success\n\nIn addition to providing the correct code and/or answer, a successful problem set will:\n\n1.
