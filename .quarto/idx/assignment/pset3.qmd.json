You must use the provided RMarkdown file to complete this problem set.\n\n- Use the RMarkdown file provided (.Rmd extension) and write your answers and code in the spaces provided. Submit the PDF that is \"knitted\" (1 file).^[This route requires a few more tools. You need to install [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). The upside? You can produce beautiful documents that show your code and output.]\n\nIf you have any issues using RMarkdown please see me in my office so we can make sure you can knit the file on your computer.\n\n\n1. [Problem Set - PDF](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/584567/)\n2. [RMardown file](https://agnesscott.instructure.com/files/584566/)\n\n\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis third problem set will help you practice:\n\n1. Setting the working directory\n2. Loading data into R\n3. Computing and interpreting the mean of a variable for different subsets of a sample\n4. Estimating the average treatment effect for a randomized experiment\n\n\nYou will use the following commands:\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\n\n# From the previous problem sets\nsetwd()\n\nread.csv()\n\nmean()\n\n# New in this problem set\n\n# Subsetting data; for example:\ndata$var1[data$var2==1]\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Criteria for success\n\nIn addition to providing the correct code and/or answer, a successful problem set will:\n\n1. Have clear explanations that demonstrate your knowledge of the material\n2. Use the \"comment out\" function to explain what the code is doing\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["../newpagelink.lua"],"toc":true,"highlight-style":"monokai","output-file":"pset3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","resources":["../CNAME"],"_quarto-vars":{"author":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","instructor":{"name":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","name_no_title":"Enrique Quezada-Llanes","email":"equezada@agnesscott.edu","url":"https://www.equezadallanes.com","twitter":"oequezada","github":"equezadallanes","office":"Buttrick Hall 315","appointment_url":null},"course":{"number":"POL 226","semester":"Fall 2023","days":"MWF","time":"10:30 AM – 11:20 AM","location":"Buttrick Hall, Room 211","dates":"August 23–December 13, 2023"},"university":{"name":"Agnes Scott College","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu"},"school":{"name":"Department of Political Science","url":"https://www.agnesscott.edu/academics/majors-minors/political-science/index.html"}},"theme":["litera","../html/custom.scss"],"title":"Problem Set 3"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
