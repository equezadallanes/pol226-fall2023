For this reason, you may do some of the things discussed here in a different order.\n\nStep 1: Develop a Research Question\nThis may perhaps the most difficult step in the research process and one where guidance is also the most difficult to provide. For our current purposes, let’s assume you have a question. Let’s use the following one as an example:\n\nDoes being religious make an individual more likely to vote?\n\nThis is a similar question to one that scholars interested on the intersection of religion and politics have asked (albeit a bit differently).\nOnce you have a research question, make sure you can identify: 1. The outcome of interest (conceptually, you don’t need to measure yet) 2. The explanatory concept (how are you trying to explain a change in the outcome? What’s having an effect on the outcome?)\nIn this example, the answers are (1) turning out to vote and (2) being religious\n\n\nStep 2"

The same is true in political science, where scholars collect and analyze data to predict and explain a variety of political phenomena such as how people vote or the degree to which public policy is influenced by interest groups. In this course, you will learn the necessary programming skills and statistical inference principles to help you think critically about politics and answer important questions. Fortunately, the skills you will learn are also in demand in many industries so they may be useful in your career beyond the classroom."

    "text": "Work and Assessment\n\nCourse Expectations\nStudents are expected to attend class and participate in class discussions and exercises. I expected you will have completed all readings prior to class and will come prepared with questions.\n\n\nCourse Workload\nThis is a 4-credit hour course, meaning that you are expected to spend 12 hours of work each week (including the 3 hours spent in the classroom). This roughly means that you will spend about 2 hours on readings for each class period, and 3 hours each week working on the different assignments (pace yourself!).\n\n\nAssignments and grades\nFinal course grades will be assigned as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nRange\nGrade\nRange\n\n\n\n\nA\n93–100%\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nA−\n90–92%\nC−\n70–72%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nB−\n80–82%\nD−\n60–62%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\nF\n&lt; 60%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal grades will be calculated based on the following components:\nParticipation (10%): All students are expected to be active participants in the class. The participation score will be determined through in-class quizzes and exercises.\n\n\nAttendance policy:\n\nAttendance is part of your participation grade, and while there is no separate grade for attendance it is a prerequisite for in-class participation. That said, to accommodate unforeseeable circumstances, you have two unexcused absences that will not affect your participation grade. Please let the instructor know about any excused absences you anticipate during the semester. It is important to keep up with class material as each portion of the course builds on previous sections.\n\nProblem Sets (40%): You will complete nine problem sets throughout the semester. These problem sets will help you practice the concepts and data analysis skills we learn in class. You will have about a week to complete each problem set. I encourage you to work together with other students, but the final product should be your own work. Problem sets are due at the beginning of the class period indicated on the schedule.\nMidterm and Final Exam (25% each): The midterm and final exam will be similar in structure to the weekly problem sets. For these exams, you will be working with some popular survey data that social scientists collect with regularity, such as the General Social Survey and American National Election Study datasets. No collaboration is permitted for the exams. However, students are allowed to use a single letter-sized sheet of hand-written notes (two-sided). Both midterm and final exams will be administered via Canvas.\nExtra Credit Opportunity: There is an additional problem set you can complete for extra credit. This can add a maximum of 3.5 percentage points to your final grade."

To be honorable, you should understand not only what counts as academic dishonesty, but also how to avoid engaging in these practices.\nYou are responsible for the content of any work submitted for this course. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate a first draft of text or code is permitted, but you must review and revise any AI-generated text or code before submission. AI text generators can be useful tools but they are often prone to factual errors, incorrect or fabricated citations, and misinterpretations of abstract concepts.
